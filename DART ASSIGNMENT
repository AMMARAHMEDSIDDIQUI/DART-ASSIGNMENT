Q1:Create two integer variables length and breadth and assign values then check if they are square values or rectangle values.
void main() {
  int age1 =2;
  int age2 =8;
  
  if(age1==age2)
  {
    print("the kids are of same age.");
  }  
  else if(age1<=age2)
  {    
    print("oldest persons age is 8");
    print("younger persons age is 2");
  }
  else{
    
  print("younger persons age is 8");
  print("oldest persons age is 2");
  }
  
}
Q.2: Take two variables and store age then using if/else condition to determine oldest and youngest among them.

void main() {
  int breath =2;
  int length =8;
  
  if(length==breath)
  {
    print("its a square.");
  }  
  else
  {
    print("its a rectangle");
  }
}
